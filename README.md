THIS BACKDOOR IS UPDATED ON 25-07-2022 / 01-12-2022

IN THIS UPDATE I REMOVED THE "server.py", I ADDED THE SCREENSHOT AND WEBCAM (only photo) FEATURE IN THE BACKDOOR ITSELF :)

Here u can see how to run the screenshot and webcam feature:-

1. Make a discord server.
2. Copy it's webhook url (see it on youtube, it's fucking easy)

NOW ASSUME THAT IT'S THE SHELL...

For Screenshot:
